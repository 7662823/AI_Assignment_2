--Student Details:

Jack Danby - Phillips (7662823)
Sean Lacy - (100858144)

--Features/Bugs/Missing:

- Features -
- Truth Table Checking
- Forward Chaining
- Backward Chaining
- Opening .txt files with and without '.txt' extension added to initial arguements


 Include a list of the features you 
have implemented. Clearly state if a 
required feature has not been implemented. Failure to 
do this will result in penalties. Include a list of 
any known bugs. 

--Test cases:

-Reading text file Test Cases
	- Test if it saved the items/names appropiately without repeats
	- test if names read are valid/not according to the file
	- check if the specified item is being queried
	- check the various items relations


 The test cases you have developed ton test
 your program. What bugs have you found? 


--Acknowledgements/Resources:
For reading from the textfile, Truth Table Check and Forward Chaining method, all resources used were given throughout either lectures or tutorials. 
For these three components, the main Acknowledgements go towards Bao for helping me understand the main concepts behind these methods fully.
Once I grasped the understanding on TT checking and FC, I was able to easily implement the code to operate efficiently and effectively.

 Include in your readme.txt file 
a list of the resources you have 
used to create your work. A simple list of URL's
 is not enough. Include with each entry a basic 
description of how the person or we
bsite assisted you in your work. 

?Notes:
 Anything else you want to tell the marker, 
such as how to use the GUI version of your 
program, and something particular about your implementation.

 Summary of the teamwork in this assignment. You need to clearly indicate who 
did what and how each team member gave feedback to
 other members. In this report, the overall 
percentage of contribution by each student to the 
project has to be clearly specified and summed to 
100%.
